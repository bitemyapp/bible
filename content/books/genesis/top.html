        "heaven" here is samayim, 9028/8026 in Strong's Hebrew concordance. Morphologically it's plural so "the heavens" seemed more literal here although "heaven and earth" has nicer prosody. No comma because I have no idea what that is accomplishing.

        "earth" is singular absolute.

        The Septuagint's Greek here seems to be something like "invisible" and "un-formed". "Deep" in the Greek is abyss. I was tempted to go with "empty" instead of void here but empty implies a "container" for the emptiness whereas void conveys uncreatedness/un-formedness better in English. I believe abyss is clearer to modern English speakers here than an antiquated use of "deep" that is evocative of the ocean deep. This could be clarified by using surface rather than face in combination with "deep" which is true to the Hebrew.
